## The Opener

![Warrior Opener as of 5.0+](https://i.imgur.com/WB2SEtL.png "Warrior Opener")

If you don't Tomahawk (ie. facepull), move Infuriate forward a GCD.

It's preferable to pull with Heavy Swing + Provoke, but in some fights with far aggro range, it is better to Tomahawk in to gain a GCD.

You can leave Nascent Flash out, or use it later to cover fight damage, but it is there for two reasons:
1) It teaches people to use Inner Release in the 2nd oGCD slot, instead of pushing it asap
2) It lines up with Upheaval, teaching people to use it like so





## Stats and Melds

[Abbreviations]() <br />
[Stats and stat tiers](http://theoryjerks.akhmorning.com/)

**What do I meld?** <br />
Crit > Comfy SkS > Det > Ten <br />

**Skill Speed (SkS) and Comfy SkS**

37 GCDs each 90s <br />
- 1015 for 2.43 GCD
- 1117 for 2.42 GCD

38 GCDs each 90s <br />
- 1523 for 2.38 GCD
- 1624 for 2.37 GCD
- 1726 for 2.36 GCD

**"Comfy"?** <br />
Some fights require extra skill speed to hit that last skill before a mechanic. <br />
One example would be E3s where you can hit Path (80 gauge) right before the first downtime. <br />
Or E11s to finish a combo before the first downtime. <br />

**Why these Skillspeeds?** <br />
Warriors want to divide the Inner Release's cooldown (90s) as evenly as possible.  <br />
90 / 2.38 = 37.97 <br />
That makes 38 GCDs between each Inner Release cast. This way, Inner Release comes up right after we finish our 38th GCD and we can re-enter the Fell Cleave spam phase. <br />
Going above or below from 2.38 GCD changes the timings so that we either wait for Inner Release to be back up or we delay it because we're still in the middle of our GCD. <br />





## Rotation
Read [the guide](http://bit.ly/XIV50WAR). <br />

**Inner Release priority**
- 5 Fell Cleaves <br />
- 1 Upheaval <br />
- 1 Onslaught <br />

## Beast Gauge

**How do I use my Beast Gauge?** <br />
Your aim is to always have at least 20g for Upheaval, or +70g for Fell Cleave + Upheaval. <br />
That gauge isn't escaping you unless you can't use it due to FIGHT ENDING. <br />
Try to hit those Fell Cleaves inside party buffs and before the fight ends. <br />

**How do I use Upheaval?** <br />
Use Inner Release's recast timer as a visual guide on whether to use Upheaval or not.

Use Upheaval when Inner Release's recast timer is at: <br />
- 88 seconds <br />
- 58 seconds <br />
- 28 seconds <br />

Because our preferred skill speeds cause Upheaval to drift, aim for: <br />
- 88~85 <br />
- 58~53 <br />
- 28~22 <br />

If your Upheaval slips out of these timers, skip it once. <br />
Be mindful of your gauge, as you would have 20g more than usual in this situation. <br />


**What about Onslaught?** <br />
To be used for: <br />
- Inside Inner Release <br />
- Gap closer to avoid GCD downtime <br />
- Gauge/Rotation manipulation <br />
